# OpenWorkbench
A complete open source electrical prototyping and development toolkit. 

## The Idea
I'm currently a broke college student in Electrical Engineering. While I do have access to equipment that can meet my needs for projects, it's annoying to have to gain access to them every time I have to use them. Plus if I want to use them at home it will cost me many thousands of dollars which I don't have.

In comes the idea of the Open Workbench: I've begun gathering and developing equipment that will condense and simplify how prototyping can be done, without neededing to hunt around eBay, auctions, or buy cheap crappy equipment from Aliexpress. 

To get started I'm going to add my Logic Analyzer. It's built off of the Pi Pico Analyzer project but includes some things that I thought would be useful or nice. There's always room for improvement and I hope everyone will contribute.

## To Do:
- Create a list of basic BUILDABLE equipment.
- Create a list of BUYABLE equipment.
- Choose a mounting system (I'm thinking DIN rails).

## Current Projects:
- ATX Voltmeter
